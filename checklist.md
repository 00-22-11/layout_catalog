- check your work using basic recommendations [here](https://github.com/mate-academy/layout_search-bar-airbnb/blob/master/checklist.md)
- use product item from `product card` task and header from `moyo header` task
- check your classes, are they ok? do they follow BEM methodology?
- remember about hover effects
- one `h1` tag per page
- don't forget about semantics, div development is not a better option 
- are you sure you've polished your code? :)
